Throughout my life, Joseph Smith’s example and learning gospel principles have influenced me for the better by teaching me how to grow my relationship with God. God fills my life with meaning, purpose, and true happiness. I don’t believe I would have come to that knowledge without knowledge of the restoration of the gospel.",

    story: "I believe that Joseph Smith really did pray to know which church to join and that God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to him.  I believe that Joseph was led, through divine guidance, to later receive and translate golden plates into what is now the Book of Mormon.  I believe that he restored ancient priesthood keys, ordinances, and doctrines and reorganized Christ's church on the earth.  Because of this restoration of knowledge and power, I am able to understand my true identity as a child of God and know Jesus Christ as a brother and Savior.  I am able to know God's plan for his children and understand my part in it.  This gives me great peace and purpose in our world of confusion and unrest.  I am also able to participate in ordinances and covenants that bind me to God and to my family for eternity.  Being a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints helps me stay connected to God through learning, fasting, prayer, revelation, prophetic counsel, opportunities for service, and renewal of covenants.  My hope is that through Jesus Christ, I can become more like God the Father, and ultimately return to live with Him.",

    story: "I have always been fascinated with the Restoration. I participated in the Hill Cumorah Pageant with my family when I was eight, and I had some meaningful experiences that provided a solid foundation at an early age for my testimony of the Restoration. This testimony has continued to grow. I have had numerous witnesses from the Spirit over the years that confirm the Church of Jesus Christ has been restored in preparation for the second coming of Christ.\n\n"+
 
    "I have always appreciated the “messiness” of the Restoration. These were regular, ordinary, imperfect people, yet they were involved in a “marvelous work and wonder.” There were amazing happenings and singular moments, but these were interspersed with long stretches of mundane life events.  I find this perspective particularly inspiring, because I can relate it to current times and my own life. I love how President Nelson has emphasized the “ongoing” nature of the Restoration.\n\n"+
     
    "A few years ago I was asked who I would choose if I could have lunch with any historical figure. After some thought, I decided on Joseph Smith. I would love to experience his personality, and I have so many questions (e.g. “What actually happened with Fanny Alger? What was really going on in Nauvoo in the 1840s with polygamy? What was it like to receive revelation?,” etc.). I know he would be the first to acknowledge his faults and imperfections. He likely made some mistakes. But I acknowledge him as the prophet of the Restoration, and I believe that through him the Book of Mormon was translated, and the priesthood and priesthood keys were restored.",

I am grateful for Joseph Smith and all he did for mankind in making it possible for us to access the atonement of Jesus Christ once again.  Without Joseph Smith, the atonement would have been futile.  I stand by the testimony that \"Joseph Smith. . . has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world\" (D&C 135). "+

I have chosen to live my life the way I do because I believe that Joseph Smith restored the priesthood to the earth and that we now have living prophets who give us direction and council. I believe they speak for God and because of that I choose to follow what they say. "+
    "As I reflect I realize how much direction and comfort I have been blessed with because of my knowledge of the restoration. I would feel so lost and hopeless if I hadn’t been blessed to know the truths that I have learned.

In this their greatest—and last—hour of need, I ask you: would these men blaspheme before God by continuing to fix their lives, their honor, and their own search for eternal salvation on a book (and by implication a church and a ministry) they had fictitiously created out of whole cloth?\n\n"+

Never mind that their little band of followers will yet be “houseless, friendless and homeless” and that their children will leave footprints of blood across frozen rivers and an untamed prairie floor.9 Never mind that legions will die and other legions live declaring in the four quarters of this earth that they know the Book of Mormon and the Church which espouses it to be true. Disregard all of that, and tell me whether in this hour of death these two men would enter the presence of their Eternal Judge quoting from and finding solace in a book which, if not the very word of God, would brand them as imposters and charlatans until the end of time? They would not do that! They were willing to die rather than deny the divine origin and the eternal truthfulness of the Book of Mormon.",

This book is the one weight on the scales of truth that exceeds the combined weight of all the critics’ arguments. Why? Because if it is true, then Joseph Smith was a prophet and this is the restored Church of Jesus Christ, regardless of any historical or other arguments to the contrary. For this reason, the critics are intent on disproving the Book of Mormon, but the obstacles they face are insurmountable because this book is true.",
